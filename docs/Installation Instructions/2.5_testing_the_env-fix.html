<h1>Step 2.5: Testing the Environment</h1>
<p>To test that your installation and packages are working properly. We are going to run a specific Environment Testing
	notebook that is also located in the "dojo-env-setup" folder. <br></p>
<h2>Running the environment tester notebook with jupyter notebook</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Next, you will close all of your previous Terminal/GitBash windows BUT before you do:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li> if your terminal is still running jupyter notebook and you do not see the prompt waiting for a command:
				<ul>
					<li> You must press "Control +C" to force-quit jupyter. </li>
					<li>Make sure to reply "y" if asked for confirmation. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If the cursor appears waiting for a new command, you are all set.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Now, return to GitHub desktop and click on the "Open in Terminal/GitBash" to open a terminal in the
			dojo-env-setup folder.</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Type pwd to confirm it says dojo-env-setup.</li>
		<li><strong>Note: if you do not see the button for Open in Terminal:</strong></li>
		<ul>
			<li> Click on the menu for "Repository" at the very top of the window (if using Windows) or at the very top
				of your screen on your menu bar (if using a Mac).</li>
			<li>You should see the word "Repository" next to the FIle, Edit, View menus.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>From the Repository menu: click on Open in Terminal/GitBash</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>In the new window that opens, start jupyter notebook by entering the <code>jupyter notebook</code>
			command in your terminal (or the "jnb" shortcut!)</strong></li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li>A new tab should open in your web browser that shows the File view for jupyter notebook.</li>
			<li>You should see all of the files that were in the dojo-env-folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>There are 2 "EnvironmentTester" notebooks:<ul>
			<li>"EnvironmentTester-mac.ipynb" for macs (both Intel and Apple Chip macs)</li>
			<li>"EnvironmentTester-windows.ipynb" for Windows.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Click on the test notebook for your OS to open it.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Once the notebook interface has loaded, you should see a toolbar with several menu choices.</li>

<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li>We want to run all of the cells in this notebook and confirm it can make it to the end without errors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>To Run the Entire Notebook:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Select the "Kernel" Menu &gt; "Restart and Run All"</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Wait patiently. </strong>The testing notebook is going to run through several modeling and EDA
				steps to confirm that the packages are working correctly. <ul>
					<li>This could take anywhere from 2-10 minutes to run. </li>
					<li>You will see the web browser tab icon turn to an hourglass when the notebook is running and back
						to an orange notebook icon when it is done.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scroll down to the bottom of the notebook and confirm the cells have run:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Check if the very last cell printed the success message.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If the entire notebook ran successfully</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Congrats! Your dojo-env is fully functional and you can move on to the next step/lesson!</li>
