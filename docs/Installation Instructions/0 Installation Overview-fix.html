<h1>Installation Overview</h1>
<p><strong>In Stack 4: Data Enrichment, you will use new tools on your computer that will require a local installation
		of Python</strong> instead of Google Colab. Please complete these installation steps <strong>by the beginning of
		Stack 4.<br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>These steps should take ~30-90 minutes,</strong> depending on the speed of your machine and internet
	connection. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup" target="_blank">dojo-env-setup
		repository</a>, which you will clone in Step 2.1, contains a backup copy of the entire set of instructions on
	the README, for convenience.</p>
<blockquote>Note: if you previously installed the dojo-env before July 7th, 2022 and are upgrading to the new one,
	please see the "Updating to New dojo-env" at the end of this chapter (after the Final Notes lesson)<br></blockquote>
<p><strong>By the end of this chapter, you will:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li> Install GitHub Desktop,</li>
	<li> Install Python via Anaconda (or via miniforge - if on a Mac with an Apple Chip)</li>
	<li> Create a special Python environment (dojo-env)</li>
	<li>Supercharge Jupyter Notebooks with Extensions</li>
	<li> Install Visual Studio Code. </li>
</ol>
<h2>If you encounter an error during installation: </h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First, read a little further down in the instructions to make sure we do not already address</strong>
		the error message that you ran into.</li>
	<li>Second, <strong>please check the "Troubleshooting" chapter</strong> for a lesson about the problem you are
		running into.<br>(The Troubleshooting section is the 3rd chapter in this course - see the screenshot below)<br>

	</li>
	<li>Third, reach out on the #ds-python-installation Discord channel (<a
			href="https://discord.com/channels/738494436467539968/999108307627294770" target="_blank">Link</a>) with:
		<ul>
			<li> What step you are on (e.g. Step 2.3 Creating the dojo-env)
			</li>
			<li>What OS you are using (e.g. Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac with an Apple Processor, etc)
			</li>
			<li>Screenshots of the error/issue you are running into, whenever possible.</li>
			<li>Finally, if you have been able to run the test notebook in Step 2.4: Testing the Env, please upload
				these files with your question. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fourth, if you do not receive a response by the end of the day on Discord, please email your instructor and cc
		jirving@codingdojo.com.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>OS-Specific Steps/Commands</h2>
<p><strong>For several steps (e.g. Step 1), there are multiple versions of the instructions, depending on what operating
		system you are using.</strong></p>
<p> (i.e. a Windows computer, vs a Mac with an Intel processor, vs a Mac with an Apple Chip (m1/m1pro/m2/etc).)</p>
<p><dfn>For step 1, please make sure you are on the correct instruction page for your OS. </dfn></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Regardless of OS, you will be using tools that serve the following purposes:<br></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Your "Terminal"/"Shell": <ul>
			<li>The primary application you will use to execute coding-related commands.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A Python Distribution:<ul>
			<li>The fundamental infrastructure for installing Python.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>GitHub Desktop:<ul>
			<li>App for working with and managing git repositories. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Our custom Python Environment (dojo-env)<ul>
			<li>A bundle of packages required for stacks 1-5+</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Jupyter Notebooks / Jupyter Lab <ul>
			<li>The primary editor we will use (instead of Colab).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Visual Studio Code<ul>
			<li>A special text editor designed for code. It has many extensions and languages available. </li>
			<li>We will use it to edit special files, but it can also run notebooks too!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: the recording below is showing the steps for installing dojo-env version 1. The steps are basically the
		same but the video does not cover the additional steps required to install the newest version of dojo-env on a
		Mac with an Apple chip (m1,m2,etc)</em></p>
